# atm-robbery
Simple ATM Robbery script that requires the player to have an 'hackingdevice' in their inventory<br>
Didn't have time to add the notification for the police. 

It's translated in Dutch

# DATABASE
Make sure to create an item in your database with your defined item in the client script ;)
